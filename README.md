# Wait & Smile
a waitlist that doesn’t ghost you after signing up

### Problem
Whenever I sign up for a waitlist on a website I feel ghosted because no welcome or greeting email is sent. 
Did it go through? How do I know I’ll receive emails? It would have been such an amazing (and tiny bit annoying) 
to receive a welcome email after signing up. Something in the lines of “Hey, thank you for joining us. We can't 
wait to launch X/do X. Until then we’ll keep you updated here.”.

### Solution
Sending "thank you" or "welcome" emails right after you sign up. I call it Wait & Smile.


**Note:** This is a 1-week project not a full-blown side project idea.
